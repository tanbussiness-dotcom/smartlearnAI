## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light teal (#94D8C3) to represent growth and learning in a modern, fresh style.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F9F8), nearly the same hue as the primary, for a clean, uncluttered, studious aesthetic.
- Accent color: Pale green (#C2EBCD) to highlight key actions and provide a sense of progress. It is close to the primary hue, but slightly more luminous.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a contemporary, precise feel. Use 'Inter' as the body font.
- Use clear and intuitive icons to represent different topics, steps, and tasks.
- Clean and responsive layout for seamless learning across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Subtle animations to enhance UX and provide visual feedback on user actions and progress.
