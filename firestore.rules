/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartLearn AI Platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and
 * progress tracking, while providing public read access to learning content
 * (topics, roadmaps, lessons, tests) with owner-only write access.
 * Administrative privileges are granted based on presence in the `roles_admin` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/progress: Tracks user learning progress.
 * - /topics/{topicId}: Stores learning topics, with 'createdBy' denormalized.
 * - /roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Stores roadmap steps.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Stores individual lessons.
 * - /tests/{testId}: Stores tests associated with lessons.
 * - /dailyTasks/{taskId}: Stores daily learning tasks with denormalized user, topic, and lesson IDs.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Used to assign admin roles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private and accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - Public read access to learning content (topics, roadmaps, lessons, tests).
 * - Owner-only write access for topics (createdBy field).
 * - Daily tasks can be queried and managed efficiently.
 * - Admin privileges are granted based on the `roles_admin` collection.
 * - Listing of user progress is allowed only for the owning user.
 * - The rules do not implement full schema validation to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `topics` collection denormalizes the `createdBy` field, allowing rules to check ownership without `get()` calls.
 * - The `dailyTasks` collection denormalizes `userId`, `topicId`, and `lessonId` for efficient querying and security.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (profiles, progress) is stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Public learning content (topics, roadmaps, lessons, tests) is stored in top-level collections.
