/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartLearn AI Platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data while allowing public read access to learning content.
 * User-specific data (e.g., profiles, daily tasks) is secured under `/users/{userId}`, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * Learning content (topics, roadmaps, lessons, tests) is organized under `/topics/{topicId}` and subcollections, with create/update/delete access restricted to the topic creator.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /topics/{topicId}: Stores learning topics. Publicly readable, but only the creator can modify.
 * - /topics/{topicId}/roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Stores roadmaps for each topic.
 * - /topics/{topicId}/roadmaps/{roadmapId}/lessons/{lessonId}: Stores lessons for each roadmap.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}/tests/{testId}: Stores tests for each lesson.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyTasks/{dailyTaskId}: Stores daily tasks for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Read-only collections are explicitly marked with `allow get, list: if true;`.
 * - The `createdBy` field is denormalized onto `Topic` documents to avoid `get()` calls in security rules.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Topic` entity includes a `createdBy` field referencing the User who created it. This allows us to secure topics and their subcollections without additional `get()` calls, improving performance and reducing costs.
